## Parameters and tips for 3D-printing a multi-target Winston-Lutz phantom

- 3D-printer used: Fusion F400
- Filament: 1.75 mm diameter high impact polystyrene (HIPS)
- Tungsten carbide BB diameter: 4.7625 mm (2.38 mm in paper)
- Layer thickness: 0.3 mm (0.6 mm in paper)
- Infill density: 20% (25% in paper)
- Number of contours: 2
- Infill pattern: 3D Isomax
- Bottom layer thickness: 1 mm
- Top layer thickness: 1.5mm
- Print Temperature: 240 Celsius
- Bed Temperature: 110 Celsius
- Fan speed target: 10% (fan speed is kept low to prevent lifting/contraction/warping of the HIPS)
- The print requires an enclosed printer where the internal temperature can be regulated
- The z-axis is programmed to move down -0.01 mm after bed leveling to provide some clearance between the filament and nozzle. 
- A brim was added to increase the surface area touching the glass plate, and to prevent lifting or contraction of the HIPS. 
- Print time: approximately 5 hours
- If the BBs do not easily slide to the bottom of the vertical cylindrical channels, manually drill out the channels to widen them slightly. A small amount of glue can be used to ensure the BBs do not move. After the BBs are in place, use a drill to completely remove the channel walls to avoid having image artefacts when the beam is directed along the channel axis. 
- Because our 3D-printer is not capable of printing the alignment lines on the sides of the phantom with adequate accuracy, these lines were added using a milling machine with an engraving tool after the print was complete. However, alignement lines on the top (anterior surface) of the phantom were able to be printed with adequate accuracy, and are therefore included in the 3D-printing design.

*Note: These parameters represent the current version of the phantom, which differ slightly from the version presented in the paper. Parameters were adjusted slightly to provide better contrast in MV images and more reliable printing.*
